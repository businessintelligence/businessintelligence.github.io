What is BI?
Business Intelligence is the use of tools and technology to convert the raw data into useful information that improves decision making process. It helps to depict the trends from history to predict the future and help Executives in making informed decisions. BI uses technology to handle large amount of unstructured data to create new opportunities and strategies based on insights which can provide businesses with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability.
BI uses a variety of tools and techniques to collect data internal and (or) external to the organization, remove noise from it and use it to analyze and query the data, create dashboards and reports for the management team.
Business Intelligence allows to spot the trends in the market and performance of products and services in the market with various attributes like profit, sales, duration, and customer purchasing trend to frame decisions for upcoming years accordingly, thus facilitates in beating business rivals. It works in a wide range from operational to strategic level.  Basic operating decisions include product positioning or pricing and strategic business decisions include priorities, goals and directions at the broadest level.BI cans use historical as well as source generated data that can be used by analysts to run queries and generate reports for decision makers, executives and end-users.

Bi is made up of number of components-
•	Statistical inference and probabilistic simulation
•	Key performance indicators optimization
•	Version control and process management
•	Real time reporting with analytical alert
•	Multidimensional aggregation and allocation
•	De-normalization, tagging and standardization
•	A method of interfacing with unstructured data sources
•	Group consolidation, budgeting and rolling forecasts
•	Open item management

BI incorporates wide data analysis applications, mobile BI, real time BI, OLAP, cloud and software as service BI. It also includes various ETL tools to convert raw data into usable form for analysis. BI also includes data visualization software for designing dashboards, reports and infographics based on Key Performance Indicators that vary from domain to domain.
Since, the introduction to BI, it have been evolving and now incorporates various other fields like data mining, text mining, predictive analytics, statistical analysis, big data analysis. These emerging fields generally requires skilled professionals like data scientists, data modelers, statisticians, people who play with data, while BI team focuses generally on querying, generating dashboards and analysis of data.
Often BI applications use data gathered from a data warehouse or from a data mart. But as data is getting unstructured, hadoop is also used now a days along with various nosql databses such as MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis and so on.
BI team generally includes BI managers, BI architects, ETL developers, BI developers, and business analysts and data management people. Thus, a large number of organizations are switching from traditional waterfall model to agile model as large project can be broken down into small independent modules that can be executed by small agile teams and deliver new functionality to end users on an incremental and iterative basis. Doing so allow companies to put BI features into use more quickly and to modify development plans as business needs change.
Applications in an enterprise-
•	Measurement – program that creates a hierarchy of performance metrics and benchmarking that informs business leaders about progress towards business goals (business process management).
•	Analytics – program that builds quantitative processes for a business to arrive at optimal decisions and to perform business knowledge discovery. Frequently involves: data mining, process mining, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, predictive modeling, business process modeling, data lineage, and complex event processing and prescriptive analytics.
•	Reporting/enterprise reporting – program that builds infrastructure for strategic reporting to serve the strategic management of a business, not operational reporting. Frequently involves data visualization, executive information system and OLAP.
•	Collaboration/collaboration platform – program that gets different areas (both inside and outside the business) to work together through data sharing and electronic data interchange.
•	Knowledge management – program to make the company data driven through strategies and practices to identify, create, represent, distribute, and enable adoption of insights and experiences that are true business knowledge. Knowledge management leads to learning management and regulatory compliance.
History-
The term Business Intelligence was coined by Richard Miller Devens’ in 1865. In a 1958 article, IBM researcher Hans Peter Luhn used the term business intelligence. He employed the Webster's dictionary definition of intelligence: "the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way as to guide action towards a desired goal." Business Intelligence has evolved from Decision Support System (DSS) that began in 1960s and developed throughout the mid-1980s. In 1989, Howard Dresner (later a Gartner Group analyst) proposed "business intelligence" as an umbrella term to describe "concepts and methods to improve business decision making by using fact-based support systems." It was not until the late 1990s that this usage was widespread. Business intelligence and business analytics are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are alternate definitions. One definition contrasts the two, stating that the term business intelligence refers to collecting business data to find information primarily through asking questions, reporting, and online analytical processes. Business analytics, on the other hand, uses statistical and quantitative tools for explanatory and predictive modeling.
